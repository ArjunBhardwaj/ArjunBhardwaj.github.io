					<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About
				</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently in the final year of my Bachelor of Technology (B-Tech) degree at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi, with a major in Computer Science and Engineering, and a minor in Intelligent Systems and German Language.
					Since Jan 2014, I have been at IIT Madras, taking up graduate courses and research projects in Artificial Intelligence.
					I am particularly interested in the fundamental areas of Story Understanding, Conversational Agents and Language Acquisition, which I see as being essentially interlinked.
					My interdisciplinary research interests relate to the emerging Cognitive Systems paradigm in AI. 
					I am on my way to a graduate degree to deepen my understanding of the field.
